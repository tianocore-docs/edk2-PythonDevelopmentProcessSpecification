# 2 Python coding guidelines and tools

This section covers python coding style guidelines followed.

###	PEP 8- Style guide for python code: 
`PEP8` covers python code style guide and helps to maintain consistency in code.
A style guide is about consistency. Consistency within a project or module or
function is most important. 
Complete specification available at
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
 

###	PEP 257- Docstring Conventions: 
`PEP257` covers semantics and conventions associated with python docstrings.
The aim of `PEP257` to standardize the high-level structure of docstrings.
Complete specification available at
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/


###	PEP 484- Type Hints: 
`PEP484` introduces a provisional module to provide the standard definitions
and tools, along with some conventions for situations where
annotations are not available. More details on PEP484 available at
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/


###   **Flake8:** 
`Flake8` is a Python library wrapper around `PyFlakes, pycodestyle` and
Ned Batchelder’s `McCabe` script<br>

  __PyFlakes:__

  *    A simple program that checks Python source files for errors.
  *    It is available on PyPI https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/

__Pydcodestyle:__

  *    `Pycodestyle` used to called pep8 is a tool to check your Python code
        against some of    the style conventions in PEP8.
  *    It is available on PyPI https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/

__McCabe:__

  *    Ned’s script to check for the `McCabe` complexity for Python code.
  *    It is available on PyPI https://pypi.org/project/mccabe/

###   **pytest:**

It is important to validate the classes, methods, and functions we write.
This will help to miniate the core software functionality of the modules.
This is possible by writing a unit test which is the first level of
software functionality validation. The `pytest` framework helps to
write small test, yet scales to support complex functional testing
for applications and libraries.

Complete features and documentation available at:
https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html

###   **mypy**:

The `mypy` tool aims to combine the benefits of dynamic and static typing.
`mypy` combines a powerful type system and compile-time type checking.
It is an optional static type checker for python.
`Mypy` type checks standard Python programs; run them using any Python VM
with basically no runtime overhead. More details available at
https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
